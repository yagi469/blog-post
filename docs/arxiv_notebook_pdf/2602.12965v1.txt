Abstract


In these lecture notes, a group-theoretical introduction to BMS symmetries is


provided in a self-contained manner. More precisely, all definitions and structures


are purely based on geometrical and group-theoretical notions defined at null in-


finity and valid in any dimension, in a way that circumvents its traditional bulk


realisation as asymptotic symmetries. The topics which are reviewed are: the


definition of BMS transformations as conformal Carrollian isometries of null in-


finity, the semidirect structure of the BMS group, the holographic reconstruction


of Minkowski spacetime in terms of good cuts, the one-to-one correspondence be-


tween good cut subspaces and Poincaré subgroups (aka vacua), as well as a basic


introduction to unitary representations of the BMS group.

1 Introduction


The Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group was initially introduced in [1, 2] as the


group of asymptotic symmetries of asymptotically flat spacetimes. To their surprise


these asymptotic symmetries turned out not to be the expected Poincaré group but,


rather, an infinite-dimensional extension of this group.


The modern significance of the BMS group is that, as was shown by Strominger


and collaborators [3,4], it is a symmetry of the (perturbative) gravity S-matrix (see


the review [5]). In this sense the BMS group appears to be of a more fundamental


nature than the Poincaré group, at least in the presence of gravitational interac-


tions. Since our mere notion of particles in quantum field theory (QFT) relies


on their realisation as unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of the Poincaré


group, these results suggest that BMS particles [6-10], i.e. UIRs of the BMS group,


might in fact improve the notion of asymptotic states in situations where gravity


must be taken into account. This possibility that BMS particles might be more


fundamental than Poincaré particles was in fact already contemplated very early


on by McCarthy as a motivation for his seminal classification of UIRs of the BMS


group [11-19].


These lecture notes intend to provide a self-contained geometrical introduction


to the BMS group, the focus being group-theoretical aspects. In particular the


present exposition will culminate in a basic introduction to the classification of


UIRs of the BMS group and we hope that it will serve as an invitation to the


subject.


Another emphasis of this review is the relationship between BMS symmetries


and null geometries. As soon as Penrose introduced the notion of asymptotically


simple spacetimes and associated conformal compactifications [20], the BMS group


was realised to be intimately tied to the intrinsic geometry of null infinity, see


e.g. [21]. This fact was related to the Carroll (i.e. $c\rightarrow0$) limit in [22] and, since


then, there has been a continuous resurgence of interest in Carrollian geometry and


related Carrollian field theories, see e.g. [23-28] for some reviews.


Throughout these notes, we will also systematically present definitions and re-


sults valid in any dimension. Some brief remarks might be in order since some


theorems have been put forward as no-go results against the existence of super-


translations or memory effects in higher dimensions [29,30]. Of course, the weak-


ness of any no-go theorem is the strength of its assumptions: A more positive way


to phrase these results is that, in higher dimensions, supertranslations and mem-


ory effects are respectively over-/sub-leading in the $1/r$ expansion, with respect


to the radiative order where gravitational waves appear. By contrast, in four di-


mensions, all these orders coincide. More precisely, memory effects do exist in any


even dimension [31-35] while supertranslations, and the BMS group, exist in any


dimension.


The plan of these notes is as follows. Section 2 reviews the relationships between


the BMS group and the geometry of null infinity. In order to do so, a step-by-step


approach to (conformal) Carrollian geometry is provided, with various useful no-


tions being introduced along the way and illustrated with basic examples. Section


3 discusses the semiproduct structure of the BMS group and the geometrical signif-


icance of some physically relevant subgroups, in particular Poincaré subgroups and


1


the related notion of gravity vacua. The title of Section 4 is "Alice in Boundary-


land" and its subtitle could have been: "How to reconstruct Minkowski spacetime


purely from data at null infinity?". On the one hand, this section reviews the no-


tion of good cuts from the bulk perspective and their correspondence with points of


Minkowski spacetime. On the other hand, it also presents the intrinsic realisation


of good cuts as paraboloids of revolution in conformally flat Carrollian spacetime.


Finally, Section 5 gives a glimpse of the classification of UIRs of the BMS group. We


particularly emphasise the hard/soft decomposition of supermomenta, with some


results in higher dimensions presented here for the first time. A short appendix


concludes this paper with various technical proofs.


2 BMS group and Carrollian geometries


To prepare the discussion of Carrollian geometries, we review various concepts


of principal R-bundles in Section 2.1 and we illustrate them in the case of null


infinity. Then, we review the main definitions of Carrollian spacetimes in Section


2.2. Finally, we conclude in Section 2.3 with their conformal generalisation relevant


for BMS symmetries.


2.1


Principal bundle geometry


Let us consider a complete nowhere vanishing vector field $n=n^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\ne0$ on a


manifold M of dimension $d+1.$ Taking the integral lines of n, a congruence of


parametrised open curves is obtained. In the language of fiber bundles, this vector


field n can, under mild assumptions¹, be thought of as the fundamental vector field


of a principal bundle


$\pi:\mathcal{H}\rightarrow\mathcal{H}$


(1)


with one-dimensional fibres being either diffeomorphic to $U(1)$ or R. We will focus


on the latter case. Consequently, the non-compact group R acts on M via shifts


of the affine parameter u. Therefore, the integral lines of n are the orbits of the


R-action.2 The space $\overline{H}$ of orbits is the base space of the principal bundle (1) and


can be seen as the quotient of the total space M by R:


$\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}/\mathbb{R}$.


(2)


Without loss of generality, such a principal R-bundle M can be assumed to be


trivial, i.e. it is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}\times\mathcal{H}$ (see e.g. Proposition 16.14.5 of [36]). The


situation outlined here is represented in Figure 1.


A coordinate system on M that will find many applications in the following of


these notes is $(u,x^{i})$, where $u\in\mathbb{R}$ denotes an affine coordinate on the fibers and


$x^{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}$ are the coordinates on the base space $(i=1,...,d)$. In these coordinates,


the expression of the fundamental vector field is simply $n=\partial/\partial u$. The integral


curves are characterised by constant base coordinates $x^{i}=x_{0}^{i}$ and are parametrised


Namely, one needs to assume that the corresponding R action on M is proper in order to ensure


that $\overline{H}$ is a manifold.


2We recall that, roughly speaking, a principal bundle has a typical fibre which can be identified (via


a diffeomorphism) to its structure group via the group action.

Figure 1: Principal R-bundle Mover M with its fundamental vector field n


by u. The R-action on M is defined by shifting u by a constant number. The


fibration (1) is locally defined as


$\pi:(u,x^{i})\mapsto x^{i}$


The coordinates $(u,x^{i})$ will be called adapted coordinates.


(3)


Example 2.1. Let us consider the conformal compactification $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$ of Minkowski


spacetime (see e.g. the section 2 of [37] for a review in any dimension). In suitable


coordinates, the Minkowski metric η on $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$ can be rewritten as $\eta=\Omega^{-2}g$ with


$g=-\frac{4dUdV}{sin^{2}(V-U)}+\gamma$ , $\Omega=\frac{2~cos(U)cos(V)}{sin(V-U)}$


(4)


Here $\mathcal{J},V\in[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]$ with $V\ge U$ are doubly null coordinates, while x and y


are, respectively, coordinates and metric on the unit round sphere $S^{d}$. Future


null infinity $g_{d+1}^{+}$, represented in Figure 2, then corresponds to the points for


which $V=\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $U\in(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})$. The fundamental vector field along null infinity,


$n:=g^{-1}\nabla\Omega[_{,g+}$, reads


$n=\frac{1}{2}cos^{2}(U)\partial_{U}$.


(5)


It is a null vector field whose integral lines are the null rays generating the past


null cone of $i^{+}$ $(V=U=\pi/2)$. The fibration $\pi:(U,x^{i})\mapsto x^{i}$ projects a point of


future null infinity $g_{d+1}^{+}$ onto the corresponding point on the celestial sphere $S^{d}$,


see Figure 3. Introducing the retarded time $u=2~tan~U$, we obtain an adapted


coordinate system $(u,x^{i})$, i.e. $n=\partial/\partial u.$


Example 2.2. More generally, the conformal boundary of an asymptotically flat


spacetime [20] is either an R-principal bundle or a $U(1)$ -principle bundle: the latter


case, which happens for Taub-NUT solutions and in any situation where the so-


called "magnetic gravitational charge" is non zero [38], is usually considered to a


be a pathology, since this implies the existence of closed causal curves, and we will


exclude this possibility.


Definition 2.3. The sections $s:S^{d}\hookrightarrow\vartheta_{d+1}$ of the ray bundle $\pi:\mathcal{F}_{d+1}\rightarrow S^{d}$


i.e. the maps s from the sphere $S^{d}$ into (either future or past) null infinity $g_{d+1}$


which are such that $\pi\circ s=id_{S^{d}}$, are called cuts. They can be identified with the


transverse spheres $S^{d}$ inside null infinity $g_{d+1}$


An example of cut is illustrated in Figure 3. Some other concepts will be useful


later on.

Invariant lift of a function


Consider a principal R-bundle $\pi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\overline{U}$ with fundamental vector field n. An


invariant function is a function $f:\mathcal{H}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ on the total space M which is constant


along the orbits, i.e. $\mathcal{L}_{n}f=0$ The set of such functions will be denoted $C_{inv}^{\infty}(\mathcal{H}).$


In the adapted coordinates $(u,x^{i})$, the invariance property simply means that the


function does not depend on the vertical coordinate u. For any invariant function


$f:\mathcal{H}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ on the total space, one can thus see that there exists a function


$\overline{f}:\mathcal{H}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ on the base space such that


$f=\pi^{*}\overline{f}=\overline{f}\circ\pi$.


(6)


From these definitions it is then clear that there exists an isomorphism between the


algebras of invariant functions f on the total space M and of functions $\overline{f}$ on the


base space M


$C_{inv}^{\infty}(\mathcal{H})\cong C^{\infty}(\mathcal{H}).$


(7)


Projection on the base space


On a principal R-bundle $\pi:\mathcal{H}\rightarrow\overline{H}$ with fundamental vector field n, two types


of vector fields can be introduced:


• Projectable vector field: $X\in\mathfrak{X}(\mathcal{H})$ such that $\mathcal{L}_{n}X=f\cdot n$, where $f\in$


$C^{\infty}(\mathcal{H})$,


• Invariant vector field: $X\in\mathfrak{X}(\mathcal{H})$ such that $\mathcal{L}_{n}X=0$.

Figure 4: Values of a projectable vector field X on M at various points


$m_{i}\in\pi^{-1}(p)$ on the fibre above a base point $p\in\mathcal{H}$


Remark 2.4. Projectable vector fields are infinitesimal automorphisms of the fibre


bundle. In fact, in the adapted coordinate system $(u,x^{i})$ introduced above they are


of the form


$X=F(u,x)\frac{\partial}{\partial u}+G^{i}(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i}}$


so they generate the coordinate transformations


$u^{\prime}=u+\epsilon~F(u,x)$, $x^{\prime}=x+\epsilon~G(x)$,


5


where e is an infinitesimally small parameter, $F\in C^{\infty}(\mathcal{H})$ and $G^{i}\in C_{inv}^{\infty}(\mathcal{H})$ ,


Intuitively, a projectable vector field is a vector field on the total space M which


is such that there is no horizontal inconsistency when projected onto the base space


M, cf. Figure 4. The only loss of information upon projection is the vertical part


along n.


Remark 2.5. Since invariant vector fields commute with the fundamental vector


field, they generate flows preserving the R-action on the fibre. In other words,


invariant vector fields are locally of the form:


$X=f(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial u}+g^{i}(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i}}$ '


and they generate automorphisms of the principal R-bundle:


$u^{\prime}=u+\epsilon~f(x)$, $x^{\prime}=x+\epsilon~g(x)$,


where f and $g^{i}\in C^{\infty}(\mathcal{H}\overline{H})$. Note that any invariant vector field is projectable.


(8)


Example 2.6. To anticipate the use that will be made of these vector fields, let


us consider an application of invariant vertical vector fields, $X=\mathcal{T}\cdot n$ with $\mathcal{T}\in$


$C_{inv}^{\infty}(\varphi_{d+1})$, in the BMS context. In this case, these particular vector fields generate


the supertranslations³, i.e. the vertical automorphisms of the ray bundle $\varphi_{d+1}\simeq$


$\mathbb{R}\times S^{d}$


$u^{\prime}=u+\mathcal{T}(x)$, $x^{\prime}=x$.


(9)


These transformations map a section of the principal bundle to another section,


i.e. a cut to another one. There are as many supertranslations as functions


$\mathcal{T}\in C^{\infty}(S^{d})$. The situation is outlined in Figure 5, where a cut s is mapped


to another cut ŝ by a supertranslation. In fact, any two cuts are related by a


unique supertranslation, so that there is an isomorphism between the affine space


$\Gamma(\mathcal{\varphi}_{d+1})$ of all cuts and the vector space $C^{\infty}(S^{d})$ of supertranslations.

3We here use the term supertranslation interchangeably with vertical automorphism. There is a slight


subtlety in how these interact with base diffeomorphisms in the case of the BMS group at null infinity.


This is due to the fact that the vertical vector field n actually transforms under Weyl transformations


of the Carrollian metric as a density of conformal weight minus 1, see (18). Accordingly the function


T above ought to transform as a conformal density of weight 1 (see Equation (21b)) and the complete


BMS action will be given by (19).

you like, but I've heard nonsense, compared with which that would be

Carrollian geometry


It is well known that the Galilean group can be obtained as a non relativistic limit,


more precisely an İnönü-Wigner contraction, of the Lorentz group. There is how-


ever another natural possible kinematical group [39,40] which can be obtained from


Lorentz by an İnönü-Wigner contraction: this is the Carroll group [41, 42], named


by Levy-Leblond in reference to Lewis Carroll for the seemingly craziness of the


causality relationship in the corresponding Carroll spacetimes (see Figure 6).


We will here review some basic elements of Carrollian geometries, having in


mind to highlight their close relationship with the BMS group and its Poincaré


subgroups. For original references on Carrollian geometries, see [43-45] for careful


comparison of Carrollian versus Galilean geometries and [23,46] for the correspond-


ing homogeneous models (see also [47-49] for the curved Cartan geometry of Carroll


gravity). For original results on conformal Carrollian geometries and their relation-


ship to null infinity, see [20, 21,50,51] (see also [52] for a description on how these


relate to Carrollian homogeneous models).


2.2.1 Temporal structure of Carrollian geometry


In the flat Carroll spacetime, all inertial observers are at rest. In particular, this


means that there is no possibility to exchange information, except via Carrollian


tachyons, between these observers. This property is another motivation (according


to Freeman Dyson [54]) for the nickname "Carroll" and is captured by the Red


Queen of the chessboard in the novel "Through the Looking-Glass" [53]:


"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do,


to keep in the same place."


7


Accordingly, in Carrollian geometry the wordlines of observers only belong to a


fixed congruence of curves in spacetime. These curves can be thought of as the


vertical orbits of a principal R-bundle. More precisely, the timelike structure of a


Carrollian spacetime M is defined as follows.


Definition 2.7. A field of observer is a nowhere vanishing vector field $n=n^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}$


on the spacetime M.


As discussed in the previous section (and under the same assumptions), the


timelike structure endows the spacetime manifold M with a structure of principal


R-bundle over the spatial manifold $\overline{H}$ with fundamental vector field n. Fur-


thermore, it provides a distinction between various types of vectors in Carrollian


geometry:


$\begin{cases}V^{\mu}=fn^{\mu}\\ V^{\mu}\ne fn^{\mu}\end{cases}$


with


{  f≠0


f>0


Timelike,


Future-oriented,


(10)


Spacelike,


with $f\in C^{\infty}(\mathcal{H})$. The integral lines of the field of observers n are called Carrollian


worldlines. The fibration is nothing but the congruence of the Carroll worldlines


of inertial observers. In a Carrollian spacetime, all observers are at rest and are


causally disconnected since all light-cones close in the $c\rightarrow0$ limit.


2.2.2 Carrollian relativity


Any affine parameter u of the field of observers n (i.e. $n=\partial/\partial u)$ is called a


Carrollian time. One should note that it is defined up to shifts $u^{\prime}=u+f(x)$


corresponding to the freedom to set the departure of the clock for every observer.


The image of a section $\iota:\overline{H}\rightarrow\mathcal{H}$ of the fibration $\pi:\mathcal{H}\rightarrow\overline{H}$ is a spacelike


submanifold $\iota(\mathcal{H})\subset\mathcal{H}$ of the spacetime manifold. These spacelike submanifolds


can be thought of as simultaneity slices for a given choice of Carrollian time. The


vertical automorphisms of the principal R-bundle take the form $u^{\prime}=u+f(x)$.


They map simultaneity slices to each other.


The Carroll relativity principle could be summarised as follows: simultaneity


is relative (leading to a democracy principle: all simultaneity slices are equal) but


rest is absolute. This contrasts with its dual limit, the Galilean $(c\rightarrow\infty)$ limit,


where the Galilei relativity principle states that: motion is relative (leading to the


democracy principle: all inertial observers are equal) but simultaneity is absolute.


Example 2.8. At null infinity $g_{d+1}$, the simultaneity slices described above co-


incide with its cuts (cf. Definition 2.3). Since supertranslations are the vertical


automorphisms of the associated principal R-bundle (cf. Example 2.6), they map


one cut to another, and thus one simultaneity slice to another.


2.2.3


Spatial structure of Carrollian geometry


The spatial world imagined by Carroll on the other side of the looking-glass is a


chessboard, which one could think as providing a collection of rulers for its inhabi-


tants, i.e. a metric along the spacelike directions.


8


Definition 2.9. A Carrollian metric is a positive semi-definite metric y on the


spacetime M whose kernel is spanned by the fundamental vector field


}


 Υμν  ≥ 0


Υμν V = 0


⇔


Vr = fn.


(11)


Remark 2.10. There is a one-to-one correspondence between invariant Carrollian


metrics $\gamma_{\mu\nu}$ metrics on M (i.e. $\mathcal{L}_{n}\gamma_{\mu\nu}=0)$ and Riemannian metrics $\overline{\gamma}_{ij}$ on the base


M. In particular, $\gamma=\pi^{*}\overline{\gamma}$.


2.2.4 Weak Carrollian structure


The time and spatial structures of a Carrollian spacetime have been defined, which


can be summarised as follows (see [55] for the early version with different terminol-


ogy).


Definition 2.11 (Henneaux, 1979). A Carrollian structure is composed of two


data: a field of observers n and a Carrollian metric y.


In the following of these notes, we will focus on invariant Carrollian structures (i.e.


Carrollian structures for which the Carrollian metric is invariant).


Example 2.12. An example of these structures is given by the flat Carroll space-


time, $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{d}.$ In this case, the field of observersis given by $n=\partial/\partial u$ and the flat


Carrollian metric is equal to the pullback of the metric on the Euclidean space


$ds_{\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{d}}^{2}=\delta_{ij}dx^{i}dx^{j}=dl_{\mathbb{R}^{d}}^{2}$ .


(12)


Example 2.13. Another example of Carrollian structure is given by future null


infinity, $\emptyset_{d+1}^{+}\simeq\mathbb{R}\times S^{d}$. In this case, the Carrollian time coincides with the retarded


time u and the Carrollian metric is equal to the pullback


$ds_{\vec{\phi}_{d+1}}^{2}=\overline{\gamma}_{ij}dy^{i}dy^{j}=dl_{S^{d}}^{2}$


(13)


of the round metric on the celestial sphere $S^{d}$. Alternatively, one can work in a


patch $(\simeq\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{d})$ covered by adapted stereographic coordinates $(u,x^{i})$ together


with the flat metric (12). This is this explicit description that we will very often


consider in the following.


Definition 2.14. A Carrollian isometry is a diffeomorphism of M preserving the


field of observers, $n^{\prime}=n$, and the Carrollian metric, $\gamma^{\prime}=\gamma$.


For an invariant Carrollian structure, these Carrollian isometries of M project onto


isometries of the Riemannian metric on the base $\mathcal{H}$


Example 2.15. A concrete and simple example of Carrollian isometries are the


vertical automorphisms of the principal R-bundle,


$u^{\prime}=u+f(x)$, $x^{\prime}=x$,


(14)


that we outlined in Section 2.1, and which are interpreted as supertranslations in the


BMS context. One can convince oneself by checking that the generator $X=f(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial u}$


indeed preserves the fundamental vector field n and the invariant metric  .


4This one-to-one correspondence holds precisely because the Carrollian metric is both invariant


$(\mathcal{L}_{n}\gamma_{\mu\nu}=0)$ and horizontal $(\gamma_{\mu\nu}n^{\nu}=0)$ in other words it is basic.


5This really is an equivalent description because null infinity $\varphi_{d+1}$ is a conformal Carrollian geometry


(see Section 2.3). One essentially does not loose any information by working in this patch as long as one


make sure that all constructions are $SO(d+1,1)$ -invariant.

2.2.5 Strong Carrollian structure


In the relativistic case, thanks to the uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection,


parallel transport is completely determined by the metric structure of spacetime.


In the Galilean case, since the cometric is degenerate, there is no unique affine


connection compatible with the Galilean structure. A stronger structure, includ-


ing the gift of an affine connection, is therefore needed in order to introduce the


gravitational field and to describe the motion of freefalling observers in a Galilean


spacetime. For a Carrollian spacetime, since the metric is degenerate (cf. Defini-


tion 2.9), one also needs to introduce a stronger structure in order to completely


describe our Carrollian geometry.


To define a general Carroll structure, we have seen earlier that one needs two


objects: a field of observers n and a Carrollian metric  . The principal R-bundle


M where this structure lives can further be endowed with a compatible affine con-


nection. This defines a strong Carrollian structure, first discussed in this context


in [56], which can be summarised as follows.


Definition 2.16 (Duval-Gibbons-Horvathy-Zhang, 2014). A strong Carrollian struc-


ture is composed of three data: a field of observers n, a Carrollian metric y and an


affine connection


which is compatible, in the sense that $\nabla n=0=\nabla\gamma$.


Example 2.17. The weak Carrollian structure of the flat Carrollian spacetime


(see Example 2.12) can be supplemented with a flat affine connection, which reads


$\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\rho}=0$ in some adapted coordinates $x^{\mu}=(u,x^{i})$.


Two basic facts about strong Carrollian structures are:


• If the Carrollian metric is not invariant $(\mathcal{L}_{n}\gamma\ne0)$, then there exists no asso-


ciated strong structure.


•  and $\nabla^{\prime}$ are two affine connections compatible with the same Carrollian


structure ( , γ) if and only if


$(\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\rho})^{\prime}=\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\rho}+S_{\mu\nu}n^{\rho}$


(15)


for some symmetric horizontal tensor field, i.e. $S_{\mu\nu}=S_{\nu\mu}$ and $S_{\mu\nu}n^{\nu}=0$.


In particular, if $(\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\rho})^{\prime}=0$ is the flat connection in an adapted coordinate


system $x^{\mu}=(u,x^{i})$ then $S_{\mu\nu}=\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}u$.


Example 2.18. For any asymptotically simple spacetime, the Levi-Civita connec-


tion of the unphysical metric induces, at null infinity, a strong Carrollian structure.


More precisely, the induced connection $\nabla$ is determined by (15) with $\nabla^{\prime}$ the flat


connection in adapted coordinates $(u,x^{i})$ and S the pullback along null infinity of


the asymptotic shear of the null geodesic congruence generated by the null vector


field $l=g^{-1}\nabla u|_{,g}$.


Definition 2.19. A strong Carrollian isometry is a diffeomorphism of M pre-


serving the field of observers $n^{\prime}=n$, the Carrollian metric $\gamma^{\prime}=\gamma$ and the affine


connection $\nabla^{\prime}=\nabla$


Note that the affine connections will always be implicitly assumed torsionless in these notes (see,


however, Appendix A of [44] for a systematic study of torsionful strong Carrollian structures).


10


Example 2.20. Consider the flat strong Carrollian structure on $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{d}$ (see Exam-


ple 2.17). As is well-known, preserving the flat affine connection $\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\rho}=0$ implies


that the second derivatives of the transformations are zero. This last condition


restricts the transformations to be affine in the coordinates, thereby leaving only


the Carrollian time translations and Carrollian boosts


$u^{\prime}=u+a+b_{i}x^{i}$, $x^{\prime}=x$,


(16)


among the vertical isometries. The condition to preserve the flat affine connection


removes the arbitrariness of the vertical automorphism given in Equation (14). The


remaining isometries arise from the base isometries: the spatial translations and


rotations of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$


The Carrollian isometries can also be described via their infinitesimal counter-


parts.


Definition 2.21. A (strong) Carroll-Killing vector field is a vector field $X\in\mathfrak{X}(\mathcal{H})$


on the Carrollian spacetime such that


$\mathcal{L}_{X}n=0$, $\mathcal{L}_{X}\gamma=0$ (and $\mathcal{L}_{X}\nabla=0$ in the strong case).


Note that $\mathcal{L}_{X}n=0\Leftrightarrow\mathcal{L}_{n}X=0$, so a Carroll-Killing vector field is necessarily


invariant.


Remark 2.22. In general, a strong Carrollian geometry will have no isometries. On


the other hand, the isometry algebra of a strong Carrollian geometry has maximal


dimension if and only if there exists a local coordinate system where the connection


is flat, i.e. $\Gamma=0$ This can be proved for example by the method of equivalence of


Cartan [52].


Example 2.23. The Lie algebra of strong Caroll-Killing vector fields on flat Carrol-


lian spacetime is the finite-dimensional Carroll algebra $\mathfrak{carr}(d+1)$. The non-trivial


commutation relations of the generators of the Carroll algebra are [41,42]


$[P_{i},B_{j}]=\delta_{ij}H$,


$[P_{i},J_{jk}]=\delta_{i[j}P_{k]}$,


$[B_{i},J_{jk}]=\delta_{i[j}B_{k]}$,


$[J_{ij},J_{kl}]=\delta_{[i[k}J_{l]j]}$,


(17a)


(17b)


(17c)


(17d)


with $J_{ij}=x_{[i}\partial_{j]}$, $P_{i}=\partial_{i}$, $H=\partial_{t}$, $B_{i}=x_{i}\partial_{t}$, which are respectively the generators


of spatial rotations, spatial translations, time translations, and Carrollian boosts.


As one can see the Carroll algebra has the structure of a semidirect sum $\mathfrak{carr}(d+1)=$


$\mathfrak{so}(d)\in\mathfrak{h}_{d}$, of the Heisenberg algebra $\mathfrak{h}_{d}$ generated by the generators $\{H,P_{i},B_{j}\}$,


on which the ideal $\mathfrak{so}(d)$, spanned by the generators $\{J_{ij}\}$, acts via rotations of the


indices.


2.3


Conformal Carrollian geometry


The conformal analogue of a Carrollian structure has been introduced in [56] (see


[20,21] for its seminal version with different terminology).


11


2.3.1 Weak conformal Carrollian structure


The conformal analogue of a Carrollian structure can be defined as follows.


Definition 2.24 (Penrose, 1962; Geroch, 1977). A conformal Carrollian structure


is an equivalence class [n,  ] of Carrollian structures, i.e. pairs (n, γ), with respect


to the following equivalence relation:


$n\sim\Omega^{-1}n$ and $\gamma\sim\Omega^{2}\gamma$,


for any positive function $\Omega>0.$ called conformal factor.


(18)


Now, one can introduce the corresponding symmetries preserving the latter


conformal structure.


Definition 2.25. A conformal Carrollian isometry is a diffeomorphism of M such


that the conformal Carrollian structure [n,  ] remains unchanged, i.e.


$n^{\prime}=\Omega^{-1}n$ and $\gamma^{\prime}=\Omega^{2}\gamma$,


for a certain conformal factor $\Omega>0$.


Remark 2.26. For an invariant Carrollian metric $(\mathcal{L}_{n}\gamma=0)$, these conformal Car-


rollian isometries of the Carrollian structure on M project onto conformal isome-


tries of the Riemannian metric on the base $\overline{H}$ In particular, the conformal factor is


invariant, $\mathcal{L}_{n}\Omega=0$ (see Appendix A.1 for a proof). As a conclusion, the conformal


Carrollian isometries of an invariant structure must be of the form


$u^{\prime}=\Omega(x)(u+\mathcal{T}(x))$,


${x^{\prime}}^{i}=G^{i}(x)$


(19)


where $G:x\mapsto x^{\prime}$ is a conformal isometry of the base with $\overline{\gamma}^{\prime}=\Omega^{2}\overline{\gamma}$ and $\Omega=\pi^{*}\overline{\Omega}$.


Example 2.27. At null infinity, we have that [21, 22]


BMS transformations = Conformal Carrollian isometries,


so we take the point of view here to define the BMS symmetries intrinsically on


the boundary as conformal Carrollian isometries of null infinity endowed with its


(universal [50]) conformal Carrollian structure.


Definition 2.28. A conformal Carroll-Killing vector field is a vector field $X\in$


$\mathfrak{X}(\mathcal{H})$


such that


with $f\in C^{\infty}(\mathcal{H})$.


$\mathcal{L}_{X}n=-f~n$, $\mathcal{L}_{X}\gamma=2f~\gamma$,


Remark 2.29. As one can see, conformal Carroll-Killing vector fields on Mare


always projectable on $\overline{H}$ Furthermore, for an invariant Carrollian metric, one has


$f\in C_{inv}^{\infty}(\mathcal{H})$ i.e. $\mathcal{L}_{n}f=0$, and any conformal Carroll-Killing vector field X on M


projects onto a conformal Killing vector field X on $\overline{H}$ i.e. $\mathcal{L}_{\overline{X}}\overline{\gamma}=2\overline{f}\overline{\gamma}$. This is


the infinitesimal version of Remark 2.26 (see also Appendix A.1 for an independent


proof).


12


In the adapted coordinates $(u,x^{i})$, the general expression of a conformal Carroll-


Killing vector field is


$X=Y+(\frac{1}{d}\overline{\nabla}_{i}Y^{i}u+\mathcal{T}(x))\frac{\partial}{\partial u}$


(20)


where $\overline{\nabla}$ is the Levi-Civita connection of the metric $\overline{\gamma}$, and the conformal Carroll-


Killing vector field $Y=Y^{i}(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i}}$ on M defines a conformal Killing vector field


$\overline{Y}=Y^{i}(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i}}$ on $\overline{H}$


Example 2.30. The Lie algebra of conformal Carroll-Killing vector fields on null


infinity $\varphi_{d+1}$ is isomorphic to the BMS algebra $\mathfrak{bm}\mathfrak{s}_{d+2}$ (cf. Example 2.27). Intro-


ducing the infinitesimal generators, $J(\overline{Y})=Y^{i}(x)\partial_{i}+\frac{1}{d}\overline{\nabla}_{i}Y^{i}(x)u\partial_{u}$ of conformal


isometries of the celestial sphere $S^{d}$, and $\mathcal{T}(x)\partial_{u}$ of supertranslations, we have the


commutation relations


$[J(\overline{Y}_{1}),J(\overline{Y}_{2})]=J(\{\overline{Y}_{1},\overline{Y}_{2}\})$,


$[J(\overline{Y}),\mathcal{T}\partial_{u}]=(Y^{i}\partial_{i}\mathcal{T}-\frac{1}{d}\overline{\nabla}_{i}Y^{i}\mathcal{T})\partial_{u}$,


$[\mathcal{T}_{1}\partial_{u},\mathcal{T}_{2}\partial_{u}]=0$.


(21a)


(21b)


(21c)


where the curly bracket on the right-hand side of (21a) stands for the Lie bracket


of vector fields. Note in particular that, from Equation (21b), one can see that


the function $\mathcal{T}\in C^{\infty}(S^{d})$ parametrising supertranslations should really be thought


of as a conformal primary field of scaling dimension -1 since it has a nontrivial


transformation law under $\mathfrak{so}(d+1,1)$.


2.3.2 Strong conformal Carrollian structure


The following conformal analogue of the notion of strong Carrollian structure was


introduced in [57] a long time ago, from a different perspective and under a different


name (see also [52, 58, 59] for an investigation on how these geometries precisely


interpolate between Carroll and classical constructions in conformal geometry).


Definition 2.31 (Ashtekar, 1981). A strong conformal Carrollian structure is an


equivalence class [n, γ, ∇] of strong Carrollian structures, with respect to the fol-


lowing equivalence relation:


$n^{\rho}\sim\Omega^{-1}n^{\rho}$, $\gamma_{\mu\nu}\sim\Omega^{2}\gamma_{\mu\nu}$


$\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\rho}\sim\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\rho}+2\Omega^{-1}\nabla_{(\mu}\Omega~\delta_{\nu)}^{\rho}+\Phi\gamma_{\mu\nu}n^{\rho}$


for any $0<\Omega\in C^{\infty}(\mathcal{H})$,


for any $\Phi\in C^{\infty}(\mathcal{H})$


where the round bracket around two indices stands for their symmetrisation with


weight one, i.e. $S_{(\mu\nu)}=S_{\mu\nu}$ for a symmetric tensor.


Example 2.32. As Ashtekar emphasised early on (see e.g. [50, 51, 57]), in four


dimensions the gravitational radiation reaching null infinity is precisely encoded by


such a choice of strong conformal Carroll geometry: we saw in Example 2.18 that


any choice of unphysical metric $\hat{g}$ for the asymptotically flat spacetime induces a


strong Carrollian geometry (n, γ,  ) along null infinity. However the unphysical


metric is only unique up to a Weyl transformation $\hat{g}\mapsto\omega^{2}\hat{g}$ This rescaling changes


the induced strong Carrollian geometry but preserves the equivalence class [n, γ,  ].


13


Definition 2.33. A strong conformal Carrollian isometry is a diffeomorphism of


M such that the strong conformal Carroll structure [n, γ, ∇ remains unchanged:


$n^{\prime\rho}=\Omega^{-1}n^{\rho}$, $\gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\prime}=\Omega^{2}\gamma_{\mu\nu}$


$\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\rho\prime}=\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\rho}+2\Omega^{-1}\partial_{(\mu}\Omega~\delta_{\nu)}^{\rho}+\Phi\gamma_{\mu\nu}n^{\rho}$,


for certain functions $\Phi\in C^{\infty}(\mathcal{H})$ and $0<\Omega\in C^{\infty}(\mathcal{H})$.


Example 2.34. Consider the conformally flat case of a strong conformal Carrollian


structure, which is such that one representative is the strong Carrollian structure


of Example 2.18. Preserving the flat affine connection $\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\rho}=0$ up to a trace,


$(\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\rho})^{\prime}=\Phi\gamma_{\mu\nu}n^{\rho}$, implies that the trace free part of the second derivatives of the


transformations is zero. This restricts the vertical transformations to be affine up


to a trace in the adapted coordinates, thereby leaving us with


$u^{\prime}=u+a+\vec{b}\cdot\vec{x}+c|\vec{x}|^{2}$, $\vec{x}^{\prime}=\vec{x}$,


(22)


as vertical automorphisms, i.e. time translations, Carroll boosts and temporal


special conformal transformations. These vertical conformal isometries should be


combined with the conformal isometries $x\mapsto x^{\prime}$ of the base. The weaker condition


of preserving the equivalence class of connections, rather then the complete affine


connection, adds one extra vertical symmetry with respect to strong Carrollian


isometries: the group of vertical Carrollian isometries extends from $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{1,d+1}$.


The strong conformal Carrollian isometries can also be described via their in-


finitesimal counterparts.


Definition 2.35. A strong conformal Carroll-Killing vector field is a vector field


$X\in\mathfrak{X}(\mathcal{H})$ on the Carrollian spacetime such that


$\mathcal{L}_{X}n=-f~n$, $\mathcal{L}_{X}\gamma=2f~\gamma$, and $\mathcal{L}_{X}\nabla=df\odot\delta+g~\gamma\otimes n$,


with $f,g\in C^{\infty}(\mathcal{H}).$ .7


In complete parallel with usual (non Carrollian) conformal geometry, a strong


conformal Carrollian geometry will have no isometries in general. The isometry


algebra of a strong conformal Carrollian geometry will have maximal dimension if


and only if the equivalence class locally contains a flat connection. What is more,


such conformal flatness of Carrollian geometry is equivalent in $d+1>3$ dimensions


(respectively, $d+1=3$ and $d+1=2$ to the vanishing of a Carrollian version of


the Weyl (resp. Cotton and Möbius curvature) tensor. A neat proof can again


be obtained by the method of equivalence of Cartan [52].


We adopted again an index free notation for brevity: denotes the symmetric tensor product and


the tensor product. Their definition is along the lines of the right-hand side expressions in Definition


2.31.


This Carrollian Cotton tensor is equivalent to Newman-Penrose coefficients $\Psi_{4}^{0}$, $\Psi_{3}^{0}$, $Im\Psi_{2}^{0}$ (see [50,


51,57] for the original result phrased in another terminology and [60] for the relationship of this tensor


with the Carroll limit of the usual Cotton tensor of conformal geometry).


This Carrollian Möbius curvature is equivalent [58,59] to the evolution equation induced on mass


and angular momentum aspect by three-dimensional Einstein equations.


14


Example 2.36. The Lie algebra of strong conformal Carroll-Killing vector fields


on flat Carrollian spacetime is the finite-dimensional conformal Carroll algebra, de-


noted by confcarr(d+1) whose generators obey the following commutation relations


$[D,H]=-H$


$[D,P_{i}]=-P_{i}$,


$[D,K_{i}]=K_{i},$


$[K,P_{i}]=-2B_{i},$


$[D,K]=K$


$[K_{i},H]=-2B_{i}$,


$[K_{i},P_{j}]=-2\delta_{ij}D-2J_{ij}$


$[K_{i},B_{j}]=-\delta_{ij}K,$


$[K_{i},J_{jk}]=\delta_{i[j}K_{k]}$ 


(23a)


(23b)


(23c)


Here the new generators are the dilatations D, and the Carrollian (temporal and


spatial) special conformal transformations K and $K_{i}$. The generators $P_{i,}$ $K_{j}$, $J_{ij}$


and D of conformal transformations of $S^{d}$ span a Lie algebra isomorphic to the


Lorentz algebra $\mathfrak{so}(d+1,1)$, whereas the generators H, K and $B_{i}$ span an Abelian


Lie algebra transforming in the vector representation $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$ under the Lorentz


algebra. In the Cartesian coordinates on the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ (i.e. the celestial


sphere $S^{d}$ deprived of a point) these translation generators read $H=\partial_{u}$, $\vec{B}=\vec{x}\partial_{u}$


$K=|\vec{x}|^{2}\partial_{u}$. All together, the generators of the above conformal extension of the


Carroll algebra span a Lie algebra isomorphic to the Poincaré algebra (see e.g.


Appendix A of [61] for the precise correspondence):


As a result


$\mathfrak{confcarrr}(d+1)\cong i\mathfrak{so}(d+1,1)$.


(24)


Poincaré transformations = Strong conformal Carrollian isometries,


so the Poincaré group can be defined intrinsically on the boundary as the group of


strong conformal Carrollian isometries of null infinity endowed with a flat structure.


Example 2.37. More generally, the strong conformal Carrollian structure induced


at the null infinity of Kerr spacetimes is flat and its isometries thus define a Poincaré


subgroup,


$ISO(d+1,1)\subset BMS_{d+2}.$


(25)


For Minkowski spacetime $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$, these Carrollian isometries of its conformal bound-


ary coincide with the restriction of the global isometries of its interior.


If the strong conformal Carrollian structure at null infinity is curved, then there


will be no strong conformal Carrollian isometries in general.


Example 2.38. For radiative spacetimes of dimension four (i.e. $d=2$, the pres-


ence of gravitational radiation implies that the strong conformal Carrollian struc-


ture at null infinity is not flat [51,57].


3 Semidirect product structure of BMS group


Minkowski spacetime is the affine10 space $\mathbb{M}_{d+2}\simeq\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$ equipped with the Minkowski


metric with signature (-, +,...,+). The group of isometries of Minkowski space-


time, i.e. the diffeomorphisms preserving the Minkowski metric, is the Poincaré


group $ISO(d+1,1)$. This group acts transitively on $\mathbb{M}_{d+2}$, thereby making it a


homogeneous space.


10Let us recall that an affine space A modeled on a vector space V is a homogeneous space for the


regular (i.e. free and transitive) action of V on A, where V is seen as an additive group. In other words,


for any pair $(a_{1},a_{2})$ of points $a_{1}$, $a_{2}\in A$ there is a unique vector $v_{12}\in V$ mapping $a_{1}$ to $a_{2}$. In colloquial


terms, an affine space is a vector space without an origin.


15


3.1 Canonical subgroups


We review the canonical normal subgroups of Poincaré and BMS groups.


3.1.1


Canonical subgroups of the Poincaré group


The following result is well-known.


Proposition 3.1. The translation group is the maximal normal subgroup $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$


of $ISO(d+1,1)$.


A proof is given in Appendix A.2 for completeness.


By this proposition, the translation group is a canonical subgroup of the Poincaré


group. Since it is normal, we can consider the quotient group $\frac{ISO(d+1,1)}{\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}}$, which is


isomorphic to the Lorentz group $SO(d+1,1)$. Furthermore, we have the canonical


projection


π : ISO(d + 1, 1)


ISO(d + 1, 1)


Rd+1,1


:ggRd+1,1


(26)


where $g\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$ denotes a left coset of the translation subgroup. The kernel of this


surjection is precisely the normal subgroup $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$.


We then have the following canonical sequence of Lie groups


$\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}\hookrightarrow ISO(d+1,1)\rightarrow^{\pi}SO(d+1,1)$


(27)


where is the canonical inclusion and the canonical surjection. Equivalently, we


can say that the Poincaré group $ISO(d+1,1)$ is a group extension of the Lorentz


group $SO(d+1,1)$ by the translation group $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$


3.1.2 Canonical subgroups of the BMS group


The previous analysis can be applied to the BMS group in an analogous way.


Supertranslation subgroup of the BMS group. We have seen in Section


2.3 that one can define $BMS_{d+2}$ as the group of conformal Carrollian isometries


of $\emptyset_{d+1}\simeq\mathbb{R}\times S^{d}$ equipped with its usual conformal Carrollian structure. The


translation group $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$ is a normal subgroup of $BMS_{d+2}$, but a larger group,


the supertranslation group11 $C^{\infty}(S^{d})$ is also a canonical normal subgroup, which


contains the translations. In fact, there is a direct analogue of the above Proposition


3.1 for the BMS group:


Theorem 3.2 (Sachs, 1962). The supertranslation group is the maximal normal


subgroup of the BMS group.


Strictly speaking, this is a slight generalisation of Lemma 2 in [2]. A proof can be


found in Appendix A.2.


We can therefore consider the quotient group $\frac{BMS(d+1,1)}{C^{\infty}(S^{d})}$


a canonical projection


and with this we have


π: BMS(d+1,1) →


BMS(d+1,1): gg C∞(Sd)


(28)


Co∞ (Sd)


${}^{11}A_{S}$ we already highlighted a couple of times, supertranslations are actually conformal primary fields


on the sphere. This can directly be seen from the action of the Lorentz group (21b).


16


whose kernel is the supertranslation subgroup $C^{\infty}(S^{d})$. Following Remark 2.26,


this map corresponds to the projection of conformal Carrollian isometries of null


infinity $\varphi_{d+1}$ onto conformal isometries of the celestial sphere $S^{d}$. The kernel of this


projection are the vertical automorphisms of the principal bundle $\emptyset_{d+1}\simeq\mathbb{R}\times S^{d}$


i.e. the supertranslations (cf. Remark 2.6). Therefore, the quotient


$\frac{BMS(d+1,1)}{C^{\infty}(S^{d})}\cong SO(d+1,1)$


identifies with the conformal group of the celestial sphere $S^{d}.$


We then have the following canonical sequence


$C^{\infty}(S^{d})\hookrightarrow^{\iota}BMS_{d+2}\rightarrow SO(d+1,1)$


(29)


(30)


where is the canonical inclusion (cf. Theorem 3.2) and the canonical surjection


(28). Equivalently, we can say that $BMS_{d+2}$ is a group extension of the Lorentz


group $SO(d+1,1)$ by the supertranslation group $C^{\infty}(S^{d})$.


Translation subgroup of the supertranslation group. The following


result is well-known in conformal geometry and in the representation theory of the


Lorentz group.


Proposition 3.3. The translation group $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$ is a canonical subgroup of the


supertranslations group $C^{\infty}(S^{d})$ characterised by the fact that it is the unique in-


variant subspace of the vector space $C^{\infty}(S^{d})$ of supertranslations, under the action


(21b) of the Lorentz group $SO(d+1,1)$


Remark 3.4. In order to make this more concrete, let us consider the ambient


formulation of the flat conformal sphere $S^{d}$ as a projective null cone in Minkowski


spacetime $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$ (see e.g. the section 2 of [37] for a review in any dimension). The


primary fields of scaling dimension -1 on $S^{d}$ (i.e. the supertranslations) can be


realised as equivalence classes of functions $F(X)$ on $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$ of homogeneity degree


1 in the Cartesian coordinates $X^{A}(A=0,1,...,d+1)$ modulo functions vanishing


on the null cone, i.e. $F(X)\sim F(X)+X^{2}G(X)$. This provides an ambient real-


isation of the space $C^{\infty}(S^{d})$ of supertranslations where the action of the Lorentz


group $SO(d+1,1)$ is linearly realised on the Cartesian coordinates. The invari-


ant subspace $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}\subset C^{\infty}(S^{d})$ corresponds to the linear functions $F(X)=T_{A}X^{A}$


which are the only homogeneous polynomial functions of degree one. Obviously,


these linear functions can be seen as the smooth solutions of the following system


of two ambient equations: $(X^{A}-1)F(X)=0$ and $\partial_{A}\partial_{B}F(X)=0.$ The former


equation implements the homogeneity condition while the latter equation picks the


translations. In terms of the flat conformal sphere $S^{d}$, the homogeneity condition


implements the scaling dimension -1 of supertranslations T while the second-order


equation translates into the following conformally-invariant equation:


$(\overline{\nabla}_{(i}\overline{\nabla}_{j)}-\frac{1}{d}\overline{\gamma}_{ij})\mathcal{T}(x)=0$.


(31)


Example 3.5. In the Cartesian coordinates on the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ (i.e. the


sphere $S^{d}$ deprived of a point), the finite translations obtained from the generators


in Example 2.36 read as $u^{\prime}=u+a+\vec{b}\cdot\vec{x}+c|\vec{x}|^{2}$ where a, $c\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\vec{b}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}.$ As


one can see, $\mathcal{T}(\vec{x})=a+b\cdot\vec{x}+c|\vec{x}|^{2}$ is indeed a solution of $(\partial_{(i}\partial_{j)}-\frac{1}{d}\delta_{ij})\mathcal{T}(\vec{x})=0,$


which is the flat version of (31).


17


3.2 Non-canonical subgroups


As we have seen, the Poincaré and BMS groups are group extensions of the Lorentz


group but there is no canonical Lorentz subgroup. The Lorentz group $SO(d+$


1,1) acts on the celestial sphere $S^{d}$ as conformal transformations and it acts on


supertranslations as primary fields on $S^{d}$ of scaling dimension -1. Accordingly,


the BMS group $BMS_{d+2}$ has an abstract structure of semidirect product, as does


the Poincaré group $ISO(d+1,1)$. Although they have an abstract structure of


semidirect products, their decomposition as a concrete semidirect product depends


on the choice of a Lorentz subgroup. These conceptual subtleties are actually of


geometrical and physical significance. They are especially important for the BMS


group.


3.2.1 Non-canonical subgroups of the Poincaré group


The Minkowski spacetime $\mathbb{M}_{d+2}\simeq\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$ is an affine space which can be viewed as


a homogeneous space for the Poincaré transformations, since they act transitively


on it. This implies that, as a homogeneous space, Minkowski spacetime can be seen


as a (left) coset space


$\mathbb{MI}_{d+2}\simeq\frac{ISO(d+1,1)}{Stab(p)}$


(32)


where $Stab(p)\subset ISO(d+1,1)$ is the stabiliser of a point $p\in\mathbb{M}_{d+2}$ for the action


of the Poincaré group $ISO(d+1,1)$ on Minkowski spacetime $\mathbb{M}_{d+2}$.


For each event p, it is easy to see that the stabiliser of this point is the subgroup


of Lorentz transformations $SO(d+1,1)$ with p as origin:


$Stab(p)=SO(d+1,1)_{p}$.


Of course, all such Lorentz subgroup are isomorphic


$SO(d+1,1)_{p}\cong SO(d+1,1)$ .


(33)


(34)


In fact, all such stabilisers are isomorphic to each other (more precisely they are


conjugate to each other via translations). Therefore, we can write


$\mathbb{M}_{d+2}\simeq\frac{ISO(d+1,1)}{SO(d+1,1)}$


(35)


without referring to the point p. The important thing to note is that because


Minkowski spacetime $\mathbb{M}_{d+2}$ is homogeneous, there is no preferred way to choose a


point p rather than another in order to compute the stabiliser. Therefore, there


is no canonical Lorentz subgroup inside the Poincaré group. Instead, we have a


one-to-one correspondence


Point $p\in\mathbb{M}_{d+2}$


←


Subgroup $SO(d+1,1)_{p}\subset ISO(d+1,1)$


(36)


If we look at the canonical sequence


$\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}\hookrightarrow ISO(d+1,1)\rightarrow^{\pi}SO(d+1,1)$ ,


(37)


choosing a point $p\in\mathbb{M}_{d+2}$ allows one to write an injection


$h_{p}:SO(d+1,1)_{p}\hookrightarrow ISO(d+1,1)$.


(38)


18


Recall that a group G is a semidirect product $G=H\ltimes N$ of a subgroup


$H\subseteq G$ acting on a normal subgroup $N\le G$ if every element $g\in G$ has a unique


decomposition as a product $g=hn$ with $h\in H$ and $n\in N$.


A choice of point $p\in\mathbb{M}_{d+2}$ in Minkowski spacetime is equivalent to a decom-


position of the Poincaré group as a semidirect product $ISO(d+1,1)\simeq SO(d+$


$1,1)_{p}\ltimes\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$ of a Lorentz subgroup $SO(d+1,1)_{p}$ acting on the translation sub-


group $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$. This example is just a warmup for the BMS group.


3.2.2 Non-canonical subgroups of the BMS group


Now we can look at the affine space of all cuts, i.e. $\Gamma(\emptyset_{d+1})$. We know from Example


2.6 that this affine space is modeled on the vector space of all supertranslations


$C^{\infty}(S^{d})$. Furthermore, the group $BMS_{d+2}$ acts transitively on $\Gamma(\mathcal{\varphi}_{d+1})$ via its


action on null infinity. This means that the affine space $\Gamma(\mathcal{g}_{d+1})$ of all cuts is a


homogeneous space which can be viewed as a (left) coset space


$\Gamma(\mathcal{F}_{d+1})\simeq\frac{BMS_{d+2}}{Stab(s)}$


(39)


where $s:S^{d}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{F}_{d+1}$ is a cut. Let us spell out the corresponding geometric picture.


Lorentz subgroups of BMS group. On $\emptyset_{d+1}\simeq\mathbb{R}\times S^{d}$ for each "trans-


verse copy" of the sphere $S^{d}$, there is a corresponding subgroup $SO(d+1,1)$ of


conformal isometries for this sphere. This can be made more precise: for each


cuts $s:S^{d}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{F}_{d+1}$, there is a corresponding subgroup $SO(d+1,1)_{s}$ of conformal


Carrolian isometries preserving the submanifold $s(S^{d})\subset\mathcal{H}_{d+1}$. Therefore:


$\Gamma(\mathcal{F}_{d+1})\simeq\frac{BMS_{d+2}}{SO(d+1,1)_{s}}$


(40)


There is no preferred section of the principal R-bundle $\emptyset_{d+1}\simeq\mathbb{R}\times S^{d}$ This


implies that there is no canonical Lorentz subgroup inside the BMS group. Instead


we have a one-to-one correspondence


Cut s of $g_{d+1}$


←→


Subgroup $SO(d+1,1)_{s}\subset BMS_{d+2}$. (41)


A choice of cut $s\in\Gamma(\mathcal{F}_{d+1})$ is also equivalent to a decomposition of the BMS group


as a semidirect product $BMS_{d+2}\simeq SO(d+1,1)_{s}\times C^{\infty}(S^{d})$ of a Lorentz subgroup


$SO(d+1,1)_{s}$ acting on the supertranslation subgroup $C^{\infty}(S^{d})$.


Putting together all the relevant groups of Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 gives the

Poincaré subgroups of BMS group. Consider a Lorentz subgroup $SO(d+$


$1,1)_{s}\subset BMS_{d+2}$ of the group. Proposition 3.3 implies that the corresponding


Poincaré group is also a subgroup of the BMS group.


$\frac{SO(d+1,1)_{s}\times\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}}{\cong ISO(d+1,1)}}\subset\frac{SO(d+1,1)_{s}\times C^{\infty}(S^{d})}{\cong BMS_{d+2}}$


(42)


Similarly to the Lorentz group, this Poincaré subgroup is not a canonical subgroup


of the BMS group. We will see now that Poincaré subgroups are in one-to-one


correspondence with the space of gravitational vacua (see e.g. [50,51]). This is


particularly transparent with the following group-theoretical definition.


Definition 3.6 (Ashtekar, 2014). A gravitational vacuum $\mathbb{M}\in\mathbb{V}$ is an equivalence


class [s] formed by all cuts related to a cuts by a translation in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}\triangleleft BMS_{d+2}$.


In other words, a gravitational vacuum is an orbit of a cut s under the action of


the translation subgroup $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$. Therefore, the affine space V of all gravitational


vacua is the homogeneous space


$\mathbb{V}\simeq\frac{\Gamma(\mathcal{Z}_{d+1})}{\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}}\simeq\frac{BMS_{d+2}}{ISO(d+1,1)}$


(43)


Accordingly, a gravitational vacuum is equivalent to a choice of Poincaré subgroup


inside the BMS group.


Choosing a particular Poincaré subgroup inside the BMS group and quotienting


by a Lorentz subgroup gives:


$ISO(d+1,1)\subset BMS_{d+2}$


↓


$\frac{ISO(d+1,1)}{SO(d+1,1)}\subset\frac{BMS_{d+2}}{SO(d+1,1)}\iff\mathbb{M}_{d+2}\subset\Gamma(\mathcal{F}_{d+1})$ .


(44)


In fact, any orbit of the translation group inside the space (Id+1) of all cuts can


be identified with a Minkowski spacetime $\mathbb{M}_{d+2}$, i.e. with a particular gravitational


vacuum, see Figure 7.


Remark 3.7. In the light of Subsection 2.3.2, one can see that a gravitational


vacuum (cf. Definition 3.6) is also equivalent to a choice of flat strong conformal


Carrollian structure on null infinity $g_{d+1}$ (this seminal observation first appeared


in [50,57]):


Gravitational vacua = Flat strong conformal Carrollian structure.

$\mathbb{M}_{1}$ to $\mathbb{M}_{2}$, whereas $T\in\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$ is a translation


This is consistent with the fact that such (equivalence classes of) compatible con-


nections indeed span an affine space (i.e. V in Definition 3.6).


Example 3.8. The example 2.37 provides us with examples of gravity vacua as


preferred Poincaré groups selected by the asymptotic geometry of a Kerr spacetime.


More precisely, any stationary asymptotically simple four-dimensional spacetime in


fact selects a particular gravitational vacuum [62].


The examples above give concrete realisations of gravity vacua. On the other


hand, our general considerations were purely kinematical and only based on group-


theoretical considerations, without any mention of dynamical gravity, thus the term


Poincaré vacuum might be more appropriate than "gravitational vacuum". Note


that this choice of terminology ("Poincaré vacuum") could be motivated as follows:


in relativistic QFT, a vacuum is the unique state annihilated by all Poincaré gener-


ators. In other words, it spans the trivial representation of the Poincaré group. Of


course, this standard axiom of QFT implicitly assumes that one is given a Poincaré


group. Accordingly, in a BMS-invariant QFT one expects a one-to-one correspon-


dence between (Poincaré-invariant) vacua and Poincaré subgroups of BMS group.


The elements of the quotient group $\frac{C^{\infty}(S^{d})}{\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}}$ of the supertranslation group by its


translation subgroup can be thought of as shifts of gravitational vacua, see Figure


8. A summary of the relevant affine spaces (and the corresponding vector spaces


they are modeled on) is provided in Table 1.


Distance between vacua. Known facts about the unitary representations of


$SO(d+1,1)$ (see e.g. [63-65] for some reviews) imply that the above vector space of


vacua shifts carries a UIR of the Lorentz group. This has important implication on


the geometry of the infinite-dimensional space of gravitational vacua: it is endowed


with a positive-definite metric.


Proposition 3.9. The vector space $\frac{C^{\infty}(S^{d})}{\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}}$ of vacua shifts is a Hilbert space car-


rying a unitary irreducible representation of $SO(d+1,1)$. This implies that the


affine space V of gravitational vacua is endowed with a Lorentz-invariant distance.


Remark 3.10. The UIR of $SO(d+1,1)$ alluded to in Proposition 3.9 belongs to the


discrete series for $d=1$, to the boundary of the principal series for $d=2$, and to the


exceptional series for $d>2$ In the conformal field theory terminology of [63-65],


one might say that $(in~d\ge2)$ the quotient space $\frac{C^{\infty}(S^{d})}{\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}}$ is spanned by the primary


field $\partial_{i}\partial_{j}\mathcal{T}-\frac{1}{d}\delta_{ij}\partial^{k}\partial_{k}\mathcal{T}$ and all its descendants, where T is a supertranslation. The


latter is a scalar primary field of scaling dimension -1, so the former primary field

$SO(1,1)\subset SO(d+1,1)$, and by the rank-two symmetric representation of the


rotation subgroup $SO(d)\subset SO(d+1,1)$.


For even d, the $SO(d+1,1)$ -invariant scalar product on the space of supertrans-


lations reads explicitly as


$\langle\mathcal{T}_{1},\mathcal{T}_{2}\rangle=\int_{S^{d}}\mathcal{T}_{1}(x)\hat{P}_{d+2}\mathcal{T}_{2}(x)\sqrt{det\overline{\gamma}(x)}d^{d}x$ ,


(45)


where $\hat{P}_{d+2}$ is the GJMS operator12 on $S^{d}$ [67,68]. The latter is a conformally-


invariant differential operator of order $d+2$ mapping primary fields of scaling


dimension -1 to primary fields of scaling dimension $d+1$ Explicitly, it reads as


follows [68]


$\hat{P}_{d+2}:=(-1)^{\frac{d}{2}+1}\prod_{j=0}^{\frac{d}{2}}(\overline{\nabla}^{2}-(\frac{d}{2}+j)(\frac{d}{2}-j-1))$ . (46)


The scalar product (45) is positive semi-definite on the vector space $C^{\infty}(S^{d})$ of


supertranslations, but it is positive-definite on the quotient space $\frac{C^{\infty}(S^{d})}{\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}}$ (see Ap-


pendix A.3 for a proof).


$[f\langle[\mathcal{T}_{1}],[\mathcal{T}_{2}]\rangle$ denotes the Lorentz-invariant scalar product on the space of gravity


shifts, then the Lorentz-invariance "distance" between two gravity vacua $\mathbb{M}_{1}$ and


$\mathbb{M}_{2}$ is equal to the norm of the shift $[\mathcal{T}]:\mathbb{M}_{1}\mapsto\mathbb{M}_{2}$ relating them


$d(\mathbb{M}_{1},\mathbb{M}_{2})=\sqrt{\langle[\mathcal{T}],[\mathcal{T}]\rangle}$.


4 Alice in Boundaryland


(47)


In this section, we would like to reconstruct Minkowski spacetime holographically,


i.e. purely from geometrical data at null infinity. Let us imagine that Alice fell in


a rabbithole and is stucked in "Boundaryland" (the conformal Carrollian manifold


$g_{d+1}$ aka null infinity. Nevertheless, she would like to reconstruct her own world,


"Interiorland" (the Lorentzian manifold $\mathbb{M}_{d+2}$) aka Minkowski spacetime, purely


from her local experiments.


This idea was very early on pushed to its ultimate consequences by Newman in


the form of his theory of Heaven-space [69], relating asymptotically shear-free null


geodesics congruence, solutions of the good-cut equations, along three-dimensional


null infinity and four-dimensional self-dual radiative (complexified) spacetimes (see


e.g. [70] for a review). We will here stuck to real, rather than complexified, space-


times for which good cuts are much more elementary and identify with points of


Minkowski spacetime.


12Note that our choice of terminology ("GJMS operator") is a slight departure from the standard one in


conformal geometry literature, because the operator $\hat{P}_{d+2}$ does not admit a Weyl-invariant generalisation


(this fact is a particular case of [66]). Nevertheless, $P_{d+2}$ is an $SO(d+1,1)$ -invariant completion of the


operator $(\overline{\nabla}^{2})^{\frac{d}{2}+1}$ on $S^{d}$

Gravitational vacua and good cuts at null infinity


From Definition 3.6, one can see that the affine space of cuts is the total space of a


principal bundle


$\Pi:\Gamma(\mathcal{O}_{d+1})\rightarrow\mathbb{V}$


over the affine space V of gravitational vacua with the translation group $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$ as


structure group. In this picture, over any specific element $v\in\mathbb{V}$ the fibre $\Pi^{-1}(v)$ is


an orbit of the translation group $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$. Each such fibre is a gravitational vacuum


which can be identified with a copy of Minkowski spacetime $\mathbb{M}_{d+2}$ inside the space


of all cuts. This motivates the following definition.


Definition 4.1. Given a gravitational vacuum $v\in\mathbb{V}$ the corresponding fibre


$\Pi^{-1}(v)\subset\Gamma(\mathcal{O}_{d+1})$ over this element is an orbit of the translation subgroup $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}\subset$


$C^{\infty}(S^{d})$. The elements s of the fibre are called the good cuts of the corresponding


gravitational vacuum.


Remark 4.2. Remember that a generic supertranslation will send one fibre to


another one, therefore a family of good cut is not a BMS-invariant notion.


4.2


Good cuts at null infinity of compactified Minkowski


spacetime


Let us now fix a gravitational vacuum, realised as a given Minkowski spacetime


$\mathbb{M}_{d+2}$ with conformal compactification $\mathbb{\mathbb{M}}_{d+2}$. Following Definition 2.3, the cuts


are sections of its null boundary, say future null infinity $\varphi_{d+1}^{+}$ The good cuts are


represented in Figure 9. In the space $\Gamma(\mathcal{G}_{d+1}^{+})$ of all cuts, one can define them as


some specific sections of $g_{d+1}^{+}$ the intersections $\emptyset_{d}=\mathcal{N}_{d+1}^{+}\cap\mathcal{F}_{d+1}^{+}$ between two


cones, the future null cone $\mathcal{N}_{d+1}^{+}$ of a bulk point $p\in\mathbb{M}_{d+2}$ and future null infinity


$\varphi_{d+1}^{+}$ Note that, from the boundary point of view, this is a choice. In fact, from


the point of view of the BMS group, there is a priori no reason to define this family


of cuts as "the good one".


The importance of the notion of good cut comes from the following property:


given the conformally compactified Minkowski spacetime $\overline{\mathbb{M}}_{d+2}$, there is a one-to-


one correspondence between these good cuts at future null infinity and points in


24


Minkowski spacetime $\mathbb{M}_{d+2}$ (aka events). This can be easily seen from Figure 9:


from one point $p\in\mathbb{M}_{d+2}$ in the bulk there is exactly one corresponding inter-


section $\emptyset_{d}\simeq S^{d}$ between its future null cone $\mathcal{N}_{d+1}^{+}$ and future null infinity $\varphi_{d+1}^{+}$.


Conversely, given a good cut $\emptyset_{d}\subset\emptyset_{d+1}^{+}$, it is by construction defining an interior


light-cone $\mathcal{N}_{d+1}^{+}$ emanating from a bulk point p.


It is important to realise that it is indeed possible to reconstruct Minkowski


spacetime purely at $g_{d+1}$ seen as a conformal Carrollian manifold, if one is given


a choice of Poincaré subgroup $ISO(d+1,1)\subset BMS_{d+2}$. This holographic recon-


struction is the subject of the next subsection.


4.3 Holographic reconstruction of Minkowski spacetime


from good cuts at null infinity


In the previous section, we have seen that there is a one-to-one correspondance


between points in the bulk of Minkowski spacetime and good cuts at $\varphi_{d+1}^{+}$ . Never-


theless, our definition of good cut refers to a point p of Minkowski spacetime. We


will see here that it is possible to characterise the good cuts intrinsically at $\varphi_{d+1}^{+}$


,


without any reference to points in the bulk. This will give a completely holographic


reconstruction of Minkowski spacetime from good cuts at null infinity.


One needs to proceed in two steps: First, choose an initial simultaneity slice,


this defines a gravity vacuum $\mathbb{M}\in\mathbb{V}$ Second, produce all the corresponding good


cuts by means of translations.


Pick a cut. We first need to choose one simultaneity slice at $g_{d+1}^{+}$


from Example 2.8 that it is equivalent to choosing a specific cut at $g_{d+1}^{+}$


is crucial since it effectively amounts to selecting a gravity vacuum.


We recall


This step


Produce the corresponding good cuts by translation. As explained


in Section 4.1, we define the subset of good cuts as the orbit under translation


of our chosen simultaneity slice. This orbit will then correspond to one specific


gravitational vacuum. Correspondingly, the set of orbits under translation of all


the simultaneity slices will be in one-to-one correspondence with the gravitational


vacua:


{Translation orbits of simultaneity slices}  {Good cuts subspaces}


→ {Minkowski spacetimes} → {Poincaré subgroups of BMS}.


(48)


In order to see the good cuts at $\varphi_{d+1}^{+}$, we will now construct the action of the


translation group on the simultaneity slice $u=u_{0}$ in the flat Carrollian spacetime


$\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{d}$ from Example 2.12 with adapted coordinates (น,   . Following the remark


in Example 2.13, this flat Carrollian spacetime is seen as representing null infinity


$\mathcal{H}_{d+1}\simeq\mathbb{R}\times S^{d}$ of which a single ray has been removed (corresponding to the point


at infinity of the base Euclidean space of the flat Carrollian spacetime). A general


translation $T\in\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$ is parametrised by an element $(a,\vec{b},c)$ in $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}$ following


the realisation in Example 3.5.


a) Under a time translation $u^{\prime}=u+a.$, the simultaneity slice $u=u_{0}$ can be sent


to another simultaneity slice $u=u_{1}$, at a different Carrollian time, see Figure


10a.


25


b) Under a Carroll boost, $u^{\prime}=u+\vec{b}\cdot\vec{x}.$ the original simultaneity slice $u=u_{0}$ is


tilted to the simultaneity slice $u=u_{0}+\vec{b}\cdot\vec{x}$ as can be seen in Figure 10b.


c) Under a Carroll temporal special conformal transformation, $u^{\prime}=u+c|\vec{x}|^{2}$, a


simultaneity slice $u=u_{0}$ is sent to a paraboloid of revolution $u=u_{0}+c|\vec{x}|^{2}$


around the time axis, as can be seen in Figure 10c.


(a)


$u=u_{0}$


$u=u_{1}$


$u=u_{0}+c|\vec{x}|^{2}$


$u=u_{0}+\vec{b}\cdot\vec{x}/$


$u=u_{0}$

$Iu=u_{0}$


(c)


Figure 10: The image of a simultaneity slice (grey hyperplane) in flat


Carroll spacetime under (a) a time translation, (b) a Carroll boost, (c)


a Carroll temporal special conformal transformation.


Therefore, declaring that this orbit defines the set of all good cuts, one can con-


clude that the good cuts are in one-to-one correspondence with the paraboloids of


revolution around their vertical axis (including their degeneration into hyperplanes


transverse to the time axis). In fact, any such a paraboloid can be described by an


equation of the form


$u=a+\vec{b}\cdot\vec{x}+c\vec{x}^{2}=c|\vec{x}+\frac{1}{2c}\vec{b}|^{2}+(a-\frac{1}{4c}|\vec{b}|^{2})$


(49)


with $(a,\vec{b},c)\in\mathbb{R}^{d+2}$. Alternatively, these good cuts can be obtained as the kernel


of (31).

Unitary irreducible representations of BMS


group


In order to investigate the implementation of BMS symmetry in QFT, one may


rest in a safe harbor by adopting the group-theoretical approach of Weinberg's


26


textbook for the foundation of relativistic QFT: if one wants to combine the rules


of quantum mechanics with special relativity, then one is naturally lead to the


standard construction of zero-, one- and multi-particle states [71]. First, the trivial


representation of the Poincaré group defines the Poincaré vacua annihilated by all


generators: the zero-particle state. Second, unitary irreducible representations of


Poincaré group are identified with the possible Hilbert spaces of one-particle states.


Third, suitably tensoring the Hilbert space of one-particle states defines the Fock


space of all multi-particle states. This motivates the systematic study of the unitary


irreducible representations of BMS group as the natural analogue of usual particles


on flat spacetime if one takes into account the asymptotic symmetries of the latter.


The classification of the unitary irreducible representations was performed for


$BMS_{4}$ by McCarthy in the seventies [11-19] (see also [9, 10, 72, 73]) and, more


recently, for $BMS_{3}$ (including super-rotations) in [6-8,74]. We will briefly sketch


the method of induced representation by starting with Poincaré group (Wigner's


classification) and then proceed to BMS group (McCarthy's classification). This


method allows for a smooth generalisation in any dimension (see e.g. the review [75]


for the Poincaré group) so our presentation holds in any dimension, but a complete


classification is beyond reach for the BMS group in higher dimensions.


5.1


Unitary irreducible representations of Poincaré group


The Poincaré group $ISO(d+1,1)$ is the semidirect product of a semisimple Lie


group, $SO(d+1,1)$, acting on an Abelian normal subgroup $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$. Furthermore,


it is finite-dimensional so Wigner's method of induced representation applies in a


straightforward way.


Let us briefly sketch this method (see e.g. [75] for more details):


1. Consider the UIRs of the translation subalgebra $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$. By Schur lemma,


they are one-dimensional representations labeled by real eigenvalues $p_{A}$ of the


Hermitian generators $\hat{P}_{A}$ which identify with the momentum eigenstates.


2. Identify the orbit and stabiliser of these eigenvalues under the action of the


Lorentz group $SO(d+1,1)$. They are respectively the mass shells $\mathcal{O}_{p}$ and the


little groups $l_{p}$ (see Table 2 for the four possible cases).


3. Choose an UIR of the little group $l_{p}$ This representation corresponds to the


"spinning" degrees of freedom or, in other words the "physical components"


of the wave function.


4. Induce the UIR of the Poincaré group $ISO(d+1,1)$ from this UIR of the little


group $l_{p}\subset SO(d+1,1)$.


In first quantisation, the elements of this infinite-dimensional Hilbert space carrying


a UIR of the Poincaré group are interpreted as the square-integrable wave function


of an elementary particle. These wave functions have support on the orbit $\mathcal{O}_{p}$ of


the momentum $p_{A}$ under the action of Lorentz group and takes values in the UIR


of the little group $l_{p}$.


5.2 Unitary irreducible representations of BMS group


The group $BMS_{d+2}$ is the semidirect product of a semisimple Lie group, $SO(d+$


1,1), acting on an Abelian normal subgroup, $C^{\infty}(S^{d})$, so the method of induced

Table 2: The four possible cases of orbits and stabilisers for real momenta


representations also applies, although some more care is in order since the Abelian


group is infinite-dimensional.


The method of induced representations mimicks the one in Section 5.1:


1. Consider the UIRs of the supertranslation subalgebra $C^{\infty}(S^{d})$ Again, by


Schur lemma they are labeled by real eigenvalues of the generators $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ These


eigenvalues can be seen as linear maps that associate to each supertranslation


generator $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ a real number. In this sense, the eigenvalues belong to the dual


of the vector space of supertranslations. Accordingly, they can be thought


of as primary fields (actually, distributions) on the celestial sphere $S^{d}$ with


scaling dimension $d+1$ They are called supermomenta, by analogy with the


Poincaré case, and will be denoted $\mathcal{P}(x)$.


The pairing between supertranslations and supermomenta reads explicitly as


(50)


$\langle\mathcal{P},\mathcal{T}\rangle=\int_{S^{d}}d^{d}x\sqrt{\overline{\gamma}(x)}\mathcal{P}(x)\mathcal{T}(x)$ .


Proposition 5.1. There is a canonical linear projection map $\pi:\mathcal{P}\mapsto p$ that


sends any supermomentum Ponto its corresponding momentum $p=\pi(\mathcal{P})$


This proposition is the dual counterpart of Proposition 3.3. In practice, the


associated momentum $p_{A}$ is obtained by considering the eigenvalues of the


generators $\hat{P}_{A}$ among the supertranslation generators $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ In practice, it reads


explicitly as


$p^{A}=\int_{S^{d}}d^{d}x\sqrt{\overline{\gamma}(x)}X^{A}(x)\mathcal{P}(x)$ , (51)


where $X^{A}(x)$ are the parametric equations of a unit sphere $S^{d}$ embedded in


$\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$ as the intersection of the null cone $X^{2}=0$ and an affine hyperplane of


the form $N_{A}X^{A}=1$ for a unit timelike vector $(N^{2}=-1)$. See Appendix A.4


for a proof of this formula.


2. Identify the orbit and stabiliser of these supermomenta under the action of


the conformal group $SO(d+1,1)$. The stabiliser of a supermomentum P is


called a BMS little group and denoted $l_{\mathcal{P}}$. It is always a subgroup $l_{\mathcal{P}}\subseteq l_{\pi(\mathcal{P})}$


of the corresponding Poincaré little group $l_{\pi(\mathcal{P})}$.


3. Choose an UIR of the BMS little group $l_{\mathcal{P}}$.


4. Induce the UIR of the BMS group $BMS_{d+2}$ from this UIR of the BMS little


group $l_{\mathcal{P}}$.


The wave function of a BMS particle has support on the orbit $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{P}}$ of the supermo-


mentum P under the action of the Lorentz group and takes values in the UIR of


the BMS little group $l_{\mathcal{P}}$.


28


Remark 5.2. The orbit of a supermomentum P is merely a coset of the (finite-


dimensional) Lorentz group


$\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{P}}\simeq\frac{SO(d+1,1)}{l_{\mathcal{P}}}$


(52)


so all orbits (or "BMS mass shells") are finite-dimensional. In this sense, the Hilbert


spaces of states for any BMS particle are relatively simple. For instance, they are


always separable (since the wave functions live on a finite-dimensional manifold).


5.2.1 Hard representations of the BMS group


We refer to [9, 10] for a systematic presentation of hard BMS representations and


how they fit into McCarthy's classification. We only here sketch essential features.


For massive particles, one can associate to any momentum PA an associated


hard supermomentum P which read as $\mathcal{P}(x)\propto(p_{A}X^{A}(x))^{-(d+1)}$ where $X^{A}(x)$


is the normalised null vector defined below Equation (51). The corresponding


representation for $d=2$ was first realised in [76]. On the other hand, the asymptotic


action of BMS on massive fields was worked out much more recently [77] and the


explicit relationship of these works to McCarthy's classification only done in [10,78].


For massless particles, it was already known to Sachs [2] that, in four dimensions,


massless fields at null infinity define a representation of $BMS_{4}$ (see [79] for the


extension to higher dimensions). As far as we know, however, it was only in [80]


that this representation was explicitly related to McCarthy's classification. The


corresponding hard supermomentum is a delta function (see the example below for


more details).


Example 5.3. In more physical terms, hard BMS particles coincide with the usual


boundary data of Poincaré particles of non-zero momentum. If $p_{A}$ is a null momen-


tum, $p^{2}=0$ then $p^{A}=\omega~q^{A}(\vec{x})$ where w is the energy and $q^{A}(\vec{x})$ is a normalised


null vector. The scattering data of a massless scalar field at null infinity will be of


the form


$\Phi(u,\vec{x})=\int d\omega(e^{-i\omega u}a^{\dagger}(\omega,\vec{x})-e^{i\omega u}a(\omega,\vec{x}))$


(53)


where $a(p)=a(\omega,\vec{x})$ are the usual Fourier modes of a massless real scalar field.


The BMS group acts on null infinity via (2.27) and therefore naturally acts on (53)


via pullback. The resulting action of a supertranslation $\mathcal{T}(\vec{x})$ is given by


$a(\omega,\vec{x})\mapsto e^{i\omega\mathcal{T}(\vec{x})}a(\omega,\vec{x})=e^{i\int d^{d}y\mathcal{P}(\vec{y})\mathcal{T}(\vec{y})}a(\omega,\vec{x})$


(54)


where $\mathcal{P}(\vec{y})=\omega~\delta^{(d)}(\vec{y}-\vec{x})$ is the massless hard supermomentum corresponding to


the momentum $p_{A}=\omega~q_{A}(\vec{x})$


Hard momenta are such that their BMS and Poincaré little groups coincide:


$l_{\mathcal{P}}=l_{\pi(\mathcal{P})}$. Therefore, the orbits of hard supermomenta coincide with usual mass


shells: $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{P}}\simeq\mathcal{O}_{\pi(\mathcal{P})}$. This implies that there is a one-to-one correspondence between


hard UIRs of BMS non-zero momentum UIRs of Poincaré.


Let us emphasise the implication of this result: for a generic BMS representation,


the choice of a gravitational vacuum $ISO(d+1,1)\subset BMS_{d+2}$ will in general


decompose the BMS wavefunction into infinitely many usual Poincaré particles.


29


In practice, this decomposition will depend on the chosen gravitational vacuum.


This does not happen for hard BMS particles: the same wavefunction can describe


both a BMS or Poincaré particle. What is more, this applies irrespectively of the


Poincaré group chosen. In this sense, hard representations are insensitive to the


choice of gravity vacua, for hard particles all Poincaré groups are equal.


5.2.2 Soft representations of the BMS group


On the opposite extreme, one can define soft supermomenta as those supermomenta


P which are such that their associated momentum is zero, $\pi(\mathcal{P})=0$ Thus their


Poincaré little group is the whole Lorentz group $SO(d+1,1)$. Therefore, a priori


the dimensions of the orbits of soft supermomenta range from 0 to $\frac{(d+2)(d+1)}{2}$. All


soft supermomenta belong to the image of the GJMS operator (46) (see Appendix


A.5 for a proof), i.e.

The zero-momentum representations of the Poincaré group $ISO(d+1,1)$ are


unfaithful UIRs of the Poincaré group (since the translations act trivially) but they


are faithful UIRs of the Lorentz group $SO(d+1,1)\simeq\frac{ISO(d+1,1)}{\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}}$ . In other words,


the zero-momentum representations of Poincaré group identify with the UIRs of


the Lorentz group. There is a similar but much richer situation for the BMS group.


The following quotient group was called the "Komar group" by McCarthy in


[12], as a credit to [81].


Definition 5.4 (McCarthy, 1972). The Komar group is the quotient group of the


BMS group by the normal subgroup of translations


$\frac{BMS_{d+2}}{\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}}\simeq SO(d+1,1)_{s}\times\frac{C^{\infty}(S^{d})}{\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}}$


which, given a cuts $s\in\Gamma(\mathcal{\varphi}_{d+1})$, decomposes as the semidirect product of the


Lorentz group acting on the normal subgroup of shifts of gravitational vacua.


Proposition 5.5. The soft representations of the BMS group $BMS_{d+2}$ of non-zero


supermomentum are unfaithful UIRs of the BMS group (since the translations act


trivially) but they are faithful UIRs of the Komar group $\frac{BMS_{d+2}}{\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}}$ . .


5.2.3 Generic representations of the BMS group


To conclude, let us consider supermomenta which are generic (i.e. neither zero, nor


hard nor soft). Their Poincaré little group $l_{\pi(\mathcal{P})}$ is a subgroup of dimension $\frac{d(d+1)}{2}$


see the three non-trivial cases in Table 2. Therefore, the dimension of the BMS


little group $l_{\mathcal{P}}\subseteq l_{\pi(\mathcal{P})}$ is bounded by this value. Consequently, the dimension of


the generic BMS mass shells (52) is between 0 and $d+1$ By analogy with what


happens for $d=2[16,19,73]$, one might speculate that the dimensions of the orbits


of soft supermomenta also range from 0 to $d+1$.


Finally, despite the fact that a generic supermomentum is neither hard nor soft,


it can always be uniquely, and in a Lorentz-invariant way, be decomposed into a


hard and a soft contribution [9, 10]:


$\mathcal{P}(x)=P_{p}(x)+\hat{P}_{d+2}\mathcal{N}(x)$


30


(56)


where $P_{p}(x)$ is the unique hard supermomentum corresponding to $p=\pi(\mathcal{P})=$


$\pi(P_{p})$ and $\hat{P}_{d+2}\mathcal{N}$ is soft (see previous subsection). The decomposition has the


interesting property of being non-linear:


$\mathcal{P}_{1}(x)+\mathcal{P}_{2}(x)=P_{3}(x)+\hat{P}_{d+2}(\mathcal{N}_{1}(x)+\mathcal{N}_{2}(x)+\mathcal{S}(x))$


(57)


where $P_{3}(x)$ is the hard supermomentum corresponding to $p_{3}=p_{1}+p_{2}$ and $\mathcal{S}(\vec{x})$


is a soft contribution encoding the non-linearity of the decomposition.


As it turns out, the term $\mathcal{S}(\vec{x})$ appearing in the last expression is in fact directly


related to Weinberg's soft factor [71]. This is not a coincidence but a manifestation


of the fact that the infrared physics of gravity is closely tied up with its asymptotic


symmetry group, see [3,4] and the review [5]. The present lecture notes are not


the place to comment further on the relationship between representation theory


of the BMS group and infrared physics; a systematic treatment will be presented


elsewhere.

Proof of the invariance of the conformal factor


Conformal Carrollian isometries. As mentioned in Remark 2.26, for an


invariant Carrollian metric, $\mathcal{L}_{n}\gamma=0$, the conformal factor is invariant, $\mathcal{L}_{n}\Omega=0.$


This follows from the two conditions in Definition 2.25. Indeed, the first condition


(i.e. $n^{\prime}=\Omega^{-1}n)$ asserts the preservation of the direction of the fundamental vector


field n, and thus the preservation of the fibration. Therefore, a conformal Carrollian


isometry is necessarily an automorphism of the fibre bundle. In turn, this implies


that it projects onto a diffeomorphism of the base. For an invariant metric, this


implies that the second condition (i.e. $\gamma^{\prime}=\Omega^{2}\gamma)$ admits a well-defined projection


$\overline{\gamma}^{\prime}=\Omega^{2}\overline{\gamma}$ Finally, this implies that $\Omega=\pi^{*}\overline{\Omega}$ must be invariant.


Conformal Carroll-Killing vector fields. The remark 2.29 is the infinites-


imal counterpart of Remark 2.26. We have to show that, for an invariant Car-


rollian metric, the function f appearing in Definition 2.28 obeys $\mathcal{L}_{n}f=0.$ This


can be shown directly as follows. The first condition in Definition 2.28 implies


$\{n,X\}=f~n$, while the second condition implies $[\mathcal{L}_{n},\mathcal{L}_{X}]\gamma=(2\mathcal{L}_{n}f)\gamma$ since


31


$\mathcal{L}_{n}\gamma=0$ One can also check that $\mathcal{L}_{fn}\gamma=0$ for any function f, since y is in-


variant and its contraction with n vanishes. Combining these various results leads


to $0=\mathcal{L}_{fn}\gamma=\mathcal{L}_{\{n,X\}}\gamma=[\mathcal{L}_{n},\mathcal{L}_{X}]\gamma=(2\mathcal{L}_{n}f)\gamma$. This shows that $\mathcal{L}_{n}f=0$.


A.2


Proof of Sachs theorem


We will proof in one shot both Proposition 3.1 (in Section 3.1.1) and Theorem 3.2


(in Section 3.1.2) by showing the following lemma, which can be applied for G the


Poincaré (or BMS) group, N the (super) translation and Q the Lorentz group.


Lemma. Let us consider a group G with a proper normal subgroup $N\triangleleft G$ Gand


corresponding quotient group $Q=\frac{G}{N}$ (i.e. a group extension G of Q by N).


If the quotient group Q is simple, then the proper normal subgroup N is maximal.


Proof: Let us proceed by contradiction. Assume that N is not a maximal normal


proper subgroup of G, that is to say there exists a proper normal subgroup $N^{\prime}\triangleleft G$


of the group G that contains the normal group $N\triangleleft G$ as a subgroup, i.e. $N\subset N^{\prime}$.


In group theory, the correspondence theorem (see e.g. Theorem 7.14 in [82]) asserts


in particular that


$N\subset N^{\prime}\triangleleft G\Rightarrow\frac{N^{\prime}}{N}\triangleleft\frac{G}{N}$


Hence, $\frac{N^{\prime}}{N}$ is a proper normal subgroup of the quotient group Q. However, the


latter group Q is assumed to be simple in the lemma. Therefore, the quotient


group


$\frac{N^{\prime}}{N}$ must be trivial, i.e. $\frac{N^{\prime}}{N}\simeq\{e\}$. In turn, this implies that $N\simeq N^{\prime};$ which


is a contradiction.

A.3


Spectrum of the GJMS operator


The issue of the positive-definiteness of the scalar product (45) reduces to the pos-


itive definiteness of the GJMS operator (46). This property can be seen concretely


by investigating its spectrum. Let us recall that the set of eigenvalues of the Lapla-


cian on $S^{d}$ is


$Spec_{L^{2}(S^{d})}(\overline{\nabla}^{2})=\{-l(l+d-1)|l\in\mathbb{N}\}$ .


Therefore, the spectrum the GJMS operator (46) is


$Spec_{L^{2}(S^{d})}(\hat{P}_{d+2})&=&\{\prod_{j=0}^{\frac{d}{2}}[l(l+d-1)+(\frac{d}{2}+j)(\frac{d}{2}-j-1)]|l\in\mathbb{N}\}$


$=\{\prod_{k=-1}^{\frac{d}{2}-1}[(l+k)(l-k+d-1)]|l\in\mathbb{N}\}$


$=\{l(l-1)\prod_{p=1}^{\frac{d-1}{2}-1}(l+p)\prod_{q=0}^{\frac{d}{2}}(l-q+d)|l\in\mathbb{N}\}.$


(58)


(59)


All factors in the last line are manifestly positive, except for the first two factors


which vanish for the first two spherical harmonics $l=0,1$ The latter harmonics


span the Lorentz-invariant subspace $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}\subset C^{\infty}(S^{d})$ of translations. Therefore,


the operator


$\hat{P}_{d+2}$ is positive-definite on the quotient space $\frac{C^{\infty}(S^{d})}{\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}}$


32


A.4 Ambient realisation of supermomenta


Recall from Remark 3.4, that supertranslations can be thought as the restriction


of functions $\mathcal{T}(X)$ on Minkowski spacetime $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$ of homogeneity degree 1 in the


Cartesian coordinates $X^{A}$, pullbacked on the light-cone $\eta_{AB}X^{A}X^{B}=0.$ Similarly,


an equivalent realisation of supermomenta is to think about them as restrictions of


homogeneous functions $\mathcal{P}(X)$ of degree $-(d+1)$ on Minkowski spacetime $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$,


also pullbacked on the light-cone $X^{2}=0$ In this formulation, the pairing (50)


between supertranslations and supermomenta reads


$\langle\mathcal{P},\mathcal{T}\rangle=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}}d^{d+2}X~\delta(X^{2})\delta(N\cdot X-1)\mathcal{P}(X)\mathcal{T}(X)$ (60)


where, in the second line, $N\in\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$ is a fixed unit timelike vector $(N^{2}=-1)$. It


can be shown that the integral does not actually depend on the choice of N; this


result is sometimes called the "covariance lemma" (see page 83 of [63]) because it


ensures the $SO(d+1,1)$ -invariance of the pairing (60).


From Remark 3.4, one knows that translations can be realised as linear func-


tions $\mathcal{T}(X)=T_{A}X^{A}$ on $\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}$. Inserting them into Equation (60) shows that the


associated momentum can be computed explicitly via the integral


$p^{A}=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{d+1,1}}d^{d+2}X~\delta(X^{2})\delta(N\cdot X-1)X^{A}\mathcal{P}(X)$ ,


which reproduces Equation (51).


A.5


Image of the GJMS operator


An elementary fact in representation theory is the following lemma.


(61)


Lemma. Consider a vector space W carrying a linear representation of a group G.


If V is the only non-trivial invariant subspace of W, then the annihilator


$Ann(V)=\{\varphi\in W^{*}|\varphi(v)=0,\forall v\in V\}$


is the only non-trivial invariant subspace of the linear dual $W^{*}$.


Proof: Consider a non-trivial invariant subspace $U\subset W^{*}$ of the linear dual. It


is clear that $Ann(U)$ is a non-trivial invariant subspace of W, thus $Ann(U)=V$


Since $Ann(Ann(U))=U$, one finds that $U=Ann(V)$.


Π


A corollary of Proposition 3.1 and the above lemma is that the space $Ker(\pi)$


of soft supermomenta is the only non-trivial $SO(d+1,1)$ -invariant subspace of


the vector space of supermomenta (since the space of soft supermomenta is, by


definition, the annihilator of the invariant subspace of translations).


A short proof that $Im(\hat{P}_{d+2})=Ker(\pi)$ now follows. The GJMS operator $\hat{P}_{d+2}$ is


an intertwiner of $SO(d+1,1)$ representations (mapping the vector space of super-


translations to the vector space of supermomenta). Therefore, its image $Im(\hat{P}_{d+2})$


is an invariant subspace of the space of supermomenta. Therefore, it must coincide


with the vector space $Ker(\pi)$ of soft supermomenta.
